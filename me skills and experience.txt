employees no longer being appraised based on their skills, rather appraisal based on how the indian unit of organization was doing
organization was not investing much to AI - we needed a bigger team for the projects we were doing - instead ended up working long hours and weeks with small team to deliver - no other experienced engineers in the team

a role that needs an ai engineeer specializing in generative ai, in combination with classic engineering skills like .Net

extremely good at learning fast - the person approached for every new technology - not that I cannot specialize, but the organization found it best to allocate my hours to the unfamiliar tasks

not good at embellishing for marketing purposes - very straightforward - sounds like "being honest is a weakness?" - but it is to a certain extent in a business - as such would like a relatively passionate team, where there is a notion of trust
